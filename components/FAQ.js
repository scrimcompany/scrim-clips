                            At the end of your match, we'll analyze your game and determine which kills are worth clipping. We automate the task of recording your highlights from the demo. Video clips are generated on our own machines and we'll upload them to the cloud for you to download and enjoy.

                            Usually this happens because you didn't have any highlights for that match â€“ refer to "What gets highlighted".

                            In general, expect an email within 10 minutes after your game. Please note that processing demos and recording clips take time depending on how many demos are in queue.

                            If you believe that there's a mistake, please let me know and I'll look into it. The least I can do is re-process the match for you.
